# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: 'Pneumonia' and 'Normal'. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing this model is a collection of chest X-ray images. The data is divided into two categories:
- **Pneumonia**: X-rays with signs of pneumonia.
- **Normal**: Healthy chest X-rays.

The dataset is available at [link to dataset].

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- PIL
- Flask (for deployment)

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
